Preliminary remark:

This addon uses the txt2tags language for the following files:
addonUserManual.t2t ;
seeAlso.t2tinc ;
support.t2tinc ;

These files are easy to translate,  all special commands are grouped by using t2tconf inclusion commands to make the text easy to read for you.

To make it easy to convert the addonUserManual.t2t and readme.md file to HTML, you would benefit from installing the "NVDA extension global plugin" addon which you can download at the following address:

https://github.com/paulber007/AllMyNVDAAddons/raw/master/NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin/NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin-11.2.nvda-addon

After install, you can update this addon by using NVDA Menu / Preferences / NVDA Extension global plugin / global settings dialog.

If you have not installed this addon, you can use the scons command or click on the makeAddon.bat file. 

Then follow these steps :

1 - Create  the  "xx" folder  of localization for the language in the  "doc" and "locale" folders. 
2 - Translation of the source code: 
You can use the "nvda.pot"  catalog file which is located in the  "locale/en" folder.
Place the  "nvda.po" and" nvda.mo" files in the  "locale/xx/LC_MESSAGES" folder (to  create). 

3Creation of locale manifest.ini
From main manifest.ini, translate "summary" and "description" variables and put these variables in an manifest.ini file (utf-8 coding).
place this file in "locale/xx" folder.

4 - Translation of the documentation of the module:
